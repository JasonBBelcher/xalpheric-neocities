  <h1>Welcome to Xalpheria</h1>

  <section class="intro">
    <p>Enter the digital realm of electronic music and immersive soundscapes. Explore my latest releases and dive into the thoughts that shape my sonic journey.</p>
    <p>I do not use A.I prompted music. All of the music is created by me, and has been as such for the past 25 years. I draw from a wide range of influences and styles.</p>
    <p>My album covers are created with generative A.I for now. They are place holders until I get around to commissioning some digital artwork. I totally suck at graphics.</p>
    <p>If anyone does that sort of thing, please email me.  I will pay you for your human creativity. As to the A.I elephant in the room, I take a nuanced but cautious view of it.</p>
    <p>I'm a software developer by trade and have watched as it has slowly eroded my value as a dev. Graphic Designers are pretty much out of a job and so are online only musicians like myself
    </p> 
    <p>Udio and Suno have flooded spotify and have started to drown out real musicians and producers. Eventually, if the billionaire class isn't stopped I believe A.I will destroy us.</p>
    <p>Conversly, if Gene Roddenberry were in charge of the A.I revolution, we could be living a utopia of unimaginable delight! It's all in how this stuff is directed.</p>
    <p>It's all about the incentive structure and right now it's all about profit and not human beings.  That is the conundrum of our age isn't it?
