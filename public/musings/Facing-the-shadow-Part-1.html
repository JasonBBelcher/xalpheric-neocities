      <p>My latest track, &quot;Face the Shadow&quot; has a deep meaning.  Though there are no words I attempted to give it the emotional underpinnings of the title.</p>
<p>What does it mean to face one’s shadow?  First we must accept that we all have a shadow to begin with. Peter Pan lost his shadow and chased it to get it back.  Just like Pan, our shadow is an important part of ourselves.  To deny it is to give it power.  Instead we should integrate it and use it in balance.  Be like the wise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn?wprov=sfti1">Qui Gon Jinn</a></p>
<p>So what am I really talking about when I throw out this word shadow in the context of a human being?  Hint, it's not just simply the bad in your soul. Just as shadows give definition to a beautiful painting, your shadow, properly integrated can give renewed vitality to the human soul.</p>
<p>Shadow can not be defined simply like a dictionary word.  It's a slightly different animal for everyone, depending on many factors that life presents.  It can however be pointed to and given definition.  Without further delay let's introduce the expert player on this subject.</p>
<p>We can’t go any further than mentioning the student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud?wprov=sfti1">Sigmund Freud</a> None other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung?wprov=sfti1">Carl Jung</a>.  He had a lot to say about these things, because he was the first to explore it and outline the shape of it.</p>
<h3><strong>1. On the Nature of the Shadow:</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.&quot;</em><br>
— <em>Psychology and Religion</em> (1938)<br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> Ignoring the shadow doesn’t make it disappear—it grows darker and more disruptive until confronted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>2. On Projection (Seeing Your Shadow in Others):</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real.&quot;</em><br>
— <em>Aion</em> (1951)<br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> We often hate in others what we refuse to see in ourselves. Facing the shadow requires brutal honesty.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>3. On the Necessity of Facing Darkness:</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.&quot;</em><br>
— <em>The Philosophical Tree</em> (1945)<br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> Spiritual or psychological growth isn’t about avoiding the shadow but illuminating it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>4. On Shadow Integration and Wholeness:</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;To confront a person with his shadow is to show him his own light.&quot;</em><br>
— <em>Good and Evil in Analytical Psychology</em> (1959)<br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> Embracing the shadow reveals hidden strengths and authenticity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>5. On the Shadow’s Power Over Us:</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.&quot;</em><br>
— <em>Psychology and Alchemy</em> (1944)<br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> Unfaced shadows control us unconsciously, leading to self-sabotage or unexplained reactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>6. On the Collective Shadow (Societal Evil):</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The most dangerous thing in life is the unconsciousness of the shadow.&quot;</em><br>
— <em>Letters, Vol. II</em><br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> Unchecked shadows fuel collective evils like prejudice, violence, and fanaticism.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>7. On the Pain of Shadow Work:</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;There is no coming to consciousness without pain.&quot;</em><br>
— <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em> (1961)<br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> Facing the shadow is uncomfortable but necessary for growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>8. On the Shadow’s Creative Potential:</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The shadow is not just a bag of flaws; it holds buried vitality, spontaneity, and even genius.&quot;</em><br>
(Paraphrased from Jung’s discussions on the shadow’s dual nature)<br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> The shadow isn’t just “bad”—it contains repressed creativity and passion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Final Thought from Jung:</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The meeting with oneself is, at first, the meeting with one’s own shadow. This is an acid test.&quot;</em><br>
— <em>The Symbolic Life</em><br>
<strong>Meaning:</strong> True self-awareness begins with shadow work.</p>

<p>In future posts, I'll do my best to unpack each bullet point above, but for now,  do that thing nobody does anymore due to smart phones. just daydream about it.  Process.</p>
