      <h1>Buzz Beginnings</h1>
<p>For my very first post I thought I’d introduce myself and what I’m about.  To be honest, I’m a<br>
god awful writer. I’ll do my best though not to bore you with run on sentences.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing music on computers now for 25 years or so.  I also play guitar and keyboards but I’d<br>
never venture to say I’m great at either one. I manage to express musical ideas in spite of my<br>
lazy musicianship. I really should do that practicing thing more often but there is so much to do<br>
and explore and so little time in this fast paced world.</p>
<p>I started out around 1996 attempting to write mod tracks with scream tracker and fast tracker.  I failed mostly.  I didn’t have hardware to sample and I had very little understanding of hexadecimal or<br>
the programming culture it comes from at the time.  Compared to those sceners I was a bumbling idiot.</p>
<p>Instead of those classic trackers, I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeskola_Buzz">buzz modular studio</a>.  It was one of, if not the first live DSP synthesis capable trackers that ever became available!  I loved it from the first time I tried it.  The workflow just clicked in my head in spite of it’s ugly somewhat spreadsheet aesthetic. I no longer needed samples of synthesizers or drums.  I could use the machines and effects that came out of the box or go looking for open source machines and fx that programmers were releasing at the time.</p>
<p>Buzz was so buggy, it originally didn’t have any protection from those famously loud clangy fatal errors where the buffer would hang and keep playing through the speakers.  I think I lost some of my hearing from it actually.  Good times LOL!</p>
<p>Buzz kept me out of a lot of trouble through the good and bad times in my youth.  I would spend countless hours making beats and learning new ways to write tunes that nobody else would ever like or hear.  I sucked for a long time before I started to impress anyone.  I cut my musical composition teeth on Buzz and I’ll be forever grateful for those times.</p>
<p>You can still find some of my really old crap music on <a href="http://buzztunes.org">buzztunes.org</a> under my old moniker : <a href="https://www.buzztunes.org/music/xaphoid">Xaphoid</a></p>
<p>I really should move all that stuff somewhere else soon.  Who knows how much longer that old site will be around.</p>
