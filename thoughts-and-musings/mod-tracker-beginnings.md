# Buzz Beginnings

For my very first post I thought I'd introduce myself and what I'm about.  To be honest, I'm a
god awful writer. I'll do my best though not to bore you with run on sentences.  

I've been writing music on computers now for 25 years or so.  I also play guitar and keyboards but I'd
never venture to say I'm great at either one. I manage to express musical ideas in spite of my 
lazy musicianship. I really should do that practicing thing more often but there is so much to do
and explore and so little time in this fast paced world.  

I started out around 1996 attempting to write mod tracks with scream tracker and fast tracker.  I failed mostly.  I didn't have hardware to sample and I had very little understanding of hexadecimal or
the programming culture it comes from at the time.  Compared to those sceners I was a bumbling idiot.

Instead of those classic trackers, I found [buzz modular studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeskola_Buzz).  It was one of, if not the first live DSP synthesis capable trackers that ever became available!  I loved it from the first time I tried it.  The workflow just clicked in my head in spite of it's ugly somewhat spreadsheet aesthetic. I no longer needed samples of synthesizers or drums.  I could use the machines and effects that came out of the box or go looking for open source machines and fx that programmers were releasing at the time.  

Buzz was so buggy, it originally didn't have any protection from those famously loud clangy fatal errors where the buffer would hang and keep playing through the speakers.  I think I lost some of my hearing from it actually.  Good times LOL!

Buzz kept me out of a lot of trouble through the good and bad times in my youth.  I would spend countless hours making beats and learning new ways to write tunes that nobody else would ever like or hear.  I sucked for a long time before I started to impress anyone.  I cut my musical composition teeth on Buzz and I'll be forever grateful for those times. 

You can still find some of my really old crap music on buzztunes.org under my old moniker : [Xaphoid](https://www.buzztunes.org/music/xaphoid)

I really should move all that stuff somewhere else soon.  Who knows how much longer that old site will be around.
